# Combination problems
# These problems will be a mix of many concepts you've learned so far, all mixed together
# For each exercise, unless explicitly asked, don't reuse the functions written for previous questions to answer
# other questions

# SECTION 1

# Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns that list


# Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and prints every element in that list
# Don't return anything


# Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the length of the list


# Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and prints every element in that list
# Return the total number of elements in the list (the length)


# Write a function that returns the sum of all numbers in a given list of numbers


# Write a function that returns the sum of all EVEN numbers in a given list of numbers
# Do not use a helper function to check even-ness


# Write a function that returns the sum of all EVEN numbers in a given list of numbers
# DO use a helper function to check even-ness


# SECTION 2

# Write a function that returns the number of strings in a given list of strings that contain the word "grey"
# Use a helper function
# Use the following steps:
# - determine what the input and output of the function should be
# - create a variable that stores the current count of satisfactory strings (strings that contain the word "grey")
# - loop through the list
# - create a helper function that tests if a string contains the word "grey"
# - inside the loop, use an in if statement to check if each string element of the list is "satisfactory".
#   if it is, add 1 to the counter
# - outside the loop (after the loop), return the answer (stored in the counter)


# SECTION 3

# Write a function that takes in a string that is either "red", "yellow", or "green", and returns true if a car may
# proceed through the intersection
