# LOOPS PROBLEMS

# SECTION 1: 

# Explain the purpose of a for loop in Python, and how it works


# Explain the purpose of a while loop in Python, and how it works


# SECTION 2: FOR LOOPS

# Write a for loop that prints numbers from 1 to 5 (inclusive)


# Write a for loop that iterates over the following list of strings and prints each fruit
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]


# Write a for loop that iterates over the following list and prints only even numbers
nums = [4, 5, 7, 8, 10]


# SECTION 3: WHILE LOOPS

# Write a while loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10 (inclusive)


# Write a while loop that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 10


# Write a while loop that calculates the sum of only the even numbers from 1 to 10


# Write a while loop that prints elements from the following list:
strings = ["never", "gonna", "give", "you", "up"]


# Using the list from the previous problem, write a while loop that prints elements before "you"


# SECTION 4: CONTROL STATEMENTS

# Explain the purpose of the break statement in a loop


# Explain the purpose of the continue statement in a loop


# SECTION 5: NESTED LOOPS

# Write a nested for loop that prints a pattern of stars (*) in the shape of a right triangle. For example:
# *
# * *
# * * *
# * * * *
