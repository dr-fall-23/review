# DATA TYPES PROBLEMS

# SECTION 1: DEFINITIONS

# In your own words, what is a number value in Python?


# In your own words, what is a boolean value in Python?


# In your own words, what is a string value in Python?


# SECTION 2: EXAMPLES

# What are the data types for the following?
# - "hi"
# - 5
# - "5"
# - True
# - []
# - ["hi"]
# - ["hi"][0]
# - [5, "hi"]
# - {}
# - {"hi": "hello"}
# - {"hi": 5}

# Give 2 examples of booleans


# Give 5 examples of numbers


# Give 5 examples of strings


# SECTION 3: NUMBER OPERATIONS

# Do the following described operations on these two numbers:
a = 5
b = 9
# - Check if a is the same as b:
# - Check if a is greater than b:
# - Check if a is greater than or equal to b:
# - Check if a is less than b:
# - Check if a is less than or equal to b:
# - Add a and b:
# - Subtract a from b:
# - Divide b by a:
# - Multiply a and b together:


# Explain the difference between integers and floating-point numbers in Python.


# Calculate the area of a rectangle with a length of 5.5 units and a width of 3 units


# Convert the result from the previous question to an integer and print the final value


# SECTION 4: BOOLEAN OPERATIONS

# - Take the AND of True and True. Also predict the result:
# - Take the AND of True and False. Also predict the result:
# - Take the AND of False and True. Also predict the result:
# - Take the AND of False and False. Also predict the result:

# - Take the OR of True and True. Also predict the result:
# - Take the OR of True and False. Also predict the result:
# - Take the OR of False and True. Also predict the result:
# - Take the OR of False and False. Also predict the result:

# - Take the NOT of False. Also predict the result:
# - Take the NOT of True. Also predict the result:

# What will be the result of this?
not (True and ((True and False) or True))

# Write a function that returns if the given input boolean is TRUE. Don't use an if statement


# Write a function that returns if the given input boolean is FALSE. Don't use an if statement


# SECTION 5: STRINGS

fun_str = "This is a cool funky string!"
# - Use the string substring function to get just "cool" from fun_str:
# - Use the string length function to get the length of fun_str:
# - What is the result of fun_str[5]?
# - Use + to create a new string that is fun_str with ":)" at the end:

# SECTION 6: Dictionaries
# Here is a dictionary that represents the ages of different people
dict = {"A": 20, "B" : 25, "C" : 19}
# To access value 'C'
# in the dictionary 'dict', 'A', 'B', and 'C' are examples of _____
#? Keys
# in the dictionary 'dict', 20, 25, and 19 are examples of _____
#? Values
# Use the dictionary to print the value of 'A'
print()


# Create a dictionary called ages and add 3 keys that represent names of people
# and 3 values that represent ages
# (they don't have to be real people)

ages = {"Joseph": 20, "Maria":21, "Marco":19}

# On the line below, add a new key value pair to the 'ages' dictionary
